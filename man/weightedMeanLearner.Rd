\title{The weighted mean meta-learner}
\usage{
weightedMeanLearner(x, y, weighted = TRUE, perf = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{data.frame} \cr
Modality-specific predictions. Each column of the \code{data.frame} content the predictions
a specific learner.}

\item{y}{\code{vector} \cr
True target values. If classification, either binary or two level factor variable.}

\item{weighted}{\cr
If TRUE, a weighted sum is computed. As default, weights are estimated based on Brier Score
for classification setting and mean squared error for regression. Otherwise, use argument
\code{perf} below to specify the function to use estimate learner performance.}

\item{perf}{\code{function} \cr
Function to compute layer-specific performance of learners. If NULL, the Brier Score (classification) or a mean squared error (regression) is used by default as performance measure.
Otherwise, the performance function must accept two parameters: \code{observed} (observed values) and \code{predicted} (predicted values).}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{weightedMeanLearner} with the vector of estimated weights pro layer.\cr
}
\description{
Modality-specific learner are assessed and weighted based on their predictions. This function is intended to be (internally) used as meta-learner in fuseMLR.
