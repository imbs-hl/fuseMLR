### fuseMLR

Cesaire J. K. Fouodo

### Introduction

Recent technological advances have enabled the simultaneous targeting of
multiple pathways to enhance therapies for complex diseases. This often
results in the collection of numerous data entities across various
layers of patient groups, posing a challenge for integrating all data
into a single analysis. Ideally, data of the different layers are
measured in the same individuals, allowing for early or intermediate
integrative techniques. However, these techniques are challenging when
patient data only partially overlap. Additionally, the internal
structure of each data entity may necessitate specific statistical
methods rather than applying the same method across all layers. Late
integration modeling addresses this by analyzing each data entity
separately to obtain layer-specific results, which are then integrated
using aggregation methods. Currently, no R package offers this
flexibility.

We introduce the fuseMLR package for late integration prediction
modeling in R. This package allows users to define studies with multiple
layers, data entities, and layer-specific machine learning methods. The
package fuseMLR is user-friendly, enables training of different models
across layers and automatically performs aggregation once layer-specific
training is completed. Additionally, fuseMLR allows for variable
selection at the layer level and makes predictions for new data
entities.

`fuseMLR` is an object-oriented package based on `R6` version 2.5.1.
Refer to our [cheat
sheet](https://github.com/imbs-hl/fuseMLR/blob/master/README_files/figure-gfm/fusemlrcheatsheet.pdf)
for a quick overview of classes and functionalities.

### Installation

Install the development version from GitHub with

``` r
devtools::install_github("imbs-hl/fuseMLR")
```

### Package overview

The following figure illustrates the general architecture of `fuseMLR`:

<img src="README_files/figure-gfm/structure.png" width="70%" height="100%" />

The general architecture of `fuseMLR` includes the storage classes
`Training`, `Layer`, and `MetaLayer`. `Layer` and `MetaLayer` are stored
within a `Training` instance, while `Data`, `Learner`, and `Varselect`
(for variable selection) are stored within a `Layer` instance. These
components can be used to automatically build and store the `Model` or
`MetaModel`.

### Usage example

The following example is based on simulated data available in `fuseMLR`.
Data have been simulated using the R package `InterSIM`, version 2.2.0.

``` r
library(fuseMLR)
library(UpSetR)
library(ranger)
library(DescTools)
```

#### A) Simulated data.

Two types of data were simulated: training and testing datasets. Each
consists of four `data.frame`sâ€”gene expression, protein expression,
methylation data, and target variable observations. Individuals are
organized in rows, variables in columns, with an additional column for
individual IDs. In total, $70$ individuals with $50$ individuals pro
layer have been simulated for training, and $23$ ($20$ per layer) for
testing. Individuals do not necessarily overlapped. Effects have been
introduced for gene expression and methylation by shifting the means by
$0.5$ to create case-control study with $50$% prevalence. Individuals do
not necessarily overlap. Effects were introduced in gene expression and
methylation by shifting the means by 0.5 to create a case-control study.
For illustration, the number of variables was kept smaller than what is
typically expected in reality. The data simulation code is available
[here](https://github.com/imbs-hl/fuseMLR/blob/master/test_code/build_data.R).

``` r
data("entities")
# This is a list containing two lists of data: training and test.
# Each sublist contains three entities.
str(object = entities, max.level = 2L)
```

    ## List of 2
    ##  $ training:List of 4
    ##   ..$ geneexpr   :'data.frame':  50 obs. of  132 variables:
    ##   ..$ proteinexpr:'data.frame':  50 obs. of  161 variables:
    ##   ..$ methylation:'data.frame':  50 obs. of  368 variables:
    ##   ..$ target     :'data.frame':  70 obs. of  2 variables:
    ##  $ testing :List of 4
    ##   ..$ geneexpr   :'data.frame':  20 obs. of  132 variables:
    ##   ..$ proteinexpr:'data.frame':  20 obs. of  161 variables:
    ##   ..$ methylation:'data.frame':  20 obs. of  368 variables:
    ##   ..$ target     :'data.frame':  30 obs. of  2 variables:

Variable selection, training and prediction are the main functionalities
of `fuseMLR`. We can perform variable selection, train and fuse models
for training studies, and predict new studies.

#### B) Instantiate training resources

We need to set up training resources.

``` r
training <- Training$new(id = "training",
                              ind_col = "IDS",
                              target = "disease",
                              target_df = entities$training$target)
# See also training$summary()
print(training)
```

    ## Training        : training
    ## Status          : Not trained
    ## Number of layers: 1
    ## Layers trained  : 0
    ## n               : 70

- Prepare new training layers: Training layers are components of a study
  and represent the second component of a `fuseMLR` object.

``` r
tl_ge <- TrainLayer$new(id = "geneexpr", training = training)
tl_pr <- TrainLayer$new(id = "proteinexpr", training = training)
tl_me <- TrainLayer$new(id = "methylation", training = training)
# We also prepare the meta layer for the meta analysis.
tl_meta <- TrainMetaLayer$new(id = "meta_layer", training = training)
```

- Add training data (entities) to layers: Exclude the meta layer, as it
  is modified internally after the training phase.

``` r
train_data_ge <- TrainData$new(id = "geneexpr",
                               train_layer = tl_ge,
                               data_frame = entities$training$geneexpr)
train_data_pr <- TrainData$new(id = "proteinexpr",
                               train_layer = tl_pr,
                               data_frame = entities$training$proteinexpr)
train_data_me <- TrainData$new(id = "methylation",
                               train_layer = tl_me,
                               data_frame = entities$training$methylation)
# An overview of the gene expression training data
print(train_data_ge)
```

    ## TrainData : geneexpr
    ## Layer     : geneexpr
    ## ind. id.  : IDS
    ## target    : disease
    ## n         : 50
    ## Missing   : 0
    ## p         : 133

``` r
# An overview of the gene expression training layer
print(tl_ge)
```

    ## TrainLayer            : geneexpr
    ## Status                : Not trained
    ## Nb. of objects stored : 1
    ## -----------------------
    ##        key     class
    ## 1 geneexpr TrainData

``` r
# An overview of the training resources
print(training)
```

    ## Training        : training
    ## Status          : Not trained
    ## Number of layers: 5
    ## Layers trained  : 0
    ## n               : 70

- An upset plot of the training data: Visualize patient overlap across
  layers.

``` r
training$upset(order.by = "freq")
```

#### C) Variable selection

We need to set up variable selection methods to our training resources.
Note that this can be the same method or different layer-specific
methods. For simplicity, we will set up the same method on all layers.

- Preparation parameters of the variable selection method.

``` r
same_param_varsel <- ParamVarSel$new(id = "ParamVarSel",
                                     param_list = list(num.trees = 1000L,
                                                       mtry = 3L,
                                                       probability = TRUE))
print(same_param_varsel)
```

    ## Class: ParamVarSel
    ## id   : ParamVarSel
    ## Parameter combination
    ## $num.trees
    ## [1] 1000
    ## 
    ## $mtry
    ## [1] 3
    ## 
    ## $probability
    ## [1] TRUE

- Instantiate the variable selection method and assign training layers.

``` r
varsel_ge <- VarSel$new(id = "varsel_geneexpr",
                        package = "Boruta",
                        varsel_fct = "Boruta",
                        param = same_param_varsel,
                        train_layer = tl_ge)

varsel_pr <- VarSel$new(id = "varsel_proteinexpr",
                        package = "Boruta",
                        varsel_fct = "Boruta",
                        param = same_param_varsel,
                        train_layer = tl_pr)
varsel_me <- VarSel$new(id = "varsel_methylation",
                        package = "Boruta",
                        varsel_fct = "Boruta",
                        param = same_param_varsel,
                        train_layer = tl_me)
```

- Perform variable selection on our training resources

``` r
set.seed(5467)
var_sel_res <- training$varSelection()
print(var_sel_res)
```

    ##          Layer   variable
    ## 1     geneexpr     ACVRL1
    ## 2     geneexpr     AKT1S1
    ## 3     geneexpr        BAX

    ## 40 methylation cg00239419
    ## 41 methylation cg23323671
    ## 42 methylation cg07160163
    ## 43 methylation cg12507125

For each layer, the variable selection results show the chosen
variables. In this example, we perform variable selection. Users can opt
to conduct variable selection on individual layers if desired.

#### D) Training

We can now train our models using the subset of selected variables.
Users can choose to set up layer-specific learners, but for
illustration, we will use the same learner for all layers.

- Set up the same leaner parameters.

``` r
same_param <- ParamLrner$new(id = "ParamRanger",
                             param_list = list(probability = TRUE,
                                               mtry = 1L),
                             hyperparam_list = list(num.trees = 1000L))
```

- Set up learners for each layer. We will use a weighted sum,
  implemented internally by `fuseMLR`, for the meta-analysis.

``` r
lrner_ge <- Lrner$new(id = "ranger",
                      package = "ranger",
                      lrn_fct = "ranger",
                      param = same_param,
                      train_layer = tl_ge)
lrner_pr <- Lrner$new(id = "ranger",
                      package = "ranger",
                      lrn_fct = "ranger",
                      param = same_param,
                      train_layer = tl_pr)
lrner_me <- Lrner$new(id = "ranger",
                      package = "ranger",
                      lrn_fct = "ranger",
                      param = same_param,
                      train_layer = tl_me)
lrner_meta <- Lrner$new(id = "weighted",
                        lrn_fct = "weightedMeanLearner",
                        param = ParamLrner$new(id = "ParamWeighted",
                                               param_list = list(),
                                               hyperparam_list = list()),
                        na_rm = FALSE,
                        train_layer = tl_meta)
```

- Train the models with the selected variables.

``` r
set.seed(5462)
# Retrieve the target variable for resampling reasons. Resampling will be used by
# fuseMLR to generate meta data.
disease <- training$getTargetValues()$disease
trained <- training$train(resampling_method = "caret::createFolds",
                                   resampling_arg = list(y = disease,
                                                         k = 2L),
                                   use_var_sel = TRUE)
# Let us now check the status of our training resources.
print(trained)
```

#### E) Predicting

Now, we have created training resources, performed variable selection
and trained the models with the chosen variables. In this section, we
create testing resources and make predictions for new data.

- Create the testing object.

``` r
testing <- Testing$new(id = "testing", ind_col = "IDS")
```

- Create new layers.

``` r
nl_ge <- TestLayer$new(id = "geneexpr", testing = testing)
nl_pr <- TestLayer$new(id = "proteinexpr", testing = testing)
nl_me <- TestLayer$new(id = "methylation", testing = testing)
```

- Instantiate and add new training data to new layers.

``` r
new_data_ge <- TestData$new(id = "geneexpr",
                           new_layer = nl_ge,
                           data_frame = entities$testing$geneexpr)
new_data_pr <- TestData$new(id = "proteinexpr",
                           new_layer = nl_pr,
                           data_frame = entities$testing$proteinexpr)
new_data_me <- TestData$new(id = "methylation",
                           new_layer = nl_me,
                           data_frame = entities$testing$methylation)
```

- An upset plot of the training data: Visualize patient overlap across
  layers.

``` r
testing$upset(order.by = "freq")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/upsetplot_new-1.png)<!-- -->

- Predict the testing object.

``` r
predictions <- training$predict(testing = testing)
print(predictions)
```
